# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in C++

## 📌 Overview

**Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions or logic. In C++, OOPS helps in building **modular, reusable, secure, and maintainable programs** by modeling real-world entities using classes and objects.

## 🧠 What is OOPS?

OOPS is a programming approach where:

* Data and functions are bundled together
* Programs are divided into objects
* Real-world problems are represented using classes

C++ supports OOPS concepts extensively, making it one of the most popular object-oriented languages.

## 🧩 Core Principles of OOPS

### 1️⃣ Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines data members and member functions.

### 2️⃣ Object

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and occupies memory.

### 3️⃣ Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of **wrapping data and functions together** into a single unit (class). It provides data security using access specifiers.

### 4️⃣ Abstraction

Abstraction hides internal implementation details and shows only essential features to the user.

### 5️⃣ Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to **acquire the properties of another class**, promoting code reusability.

### 6️⃣ Polymorphism

Polymorphism means **many forms**. It allows the same function or operator to behave differently in different situations.

## 🔐 Access Specifiers in C++

* **Public** – accessible from anywhere
* **Private** – accessible only within the class
* **Protected** – accessible within the class and derived classes

---

## ✅ Advantages of OOPS

* Improves code reusability
* Enhances security and data hiding
* Makes programs easier to maintain
* Reduces code complexity
* Supports real-world modeling

---

## ❌ Limitations of OOPS

* Requires more memory
* Programs may be slower compared to procedural programming
* Not suitable for small, simple programs

## 📚 Exam-Oriented Definition

> **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure programs, emphasizing concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

OOPS in C++ provides a powerful and structured way to design software systems. By using objects and classes, it improves readability, scalability, and maintainability of programs, making it ideal for both academic learning and real-world application development.

✨ *OOPS is the foundation of modern C++ programming and an essential concept for every computer science student.*
